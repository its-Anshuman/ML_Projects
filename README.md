# üß† ML Projects from YouTube (Replicated)

This repository contains **re-implemented machine learning projects** that I have learned by following tutorials from various YouTube channels.

The aim is to **practice ML implementation, understand code, and improve my skills**, while always **giving credit to the original creators**.
